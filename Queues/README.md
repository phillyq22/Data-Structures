# Queues
# Author: Philip S. Quinn
## Version: 1/15/18
### Queues follow a First in First Out (FIFO) ordering of items, kind of like waiting in a line at the movies. Arrays are initialized to size of 3. Drivers are provided to allow for testing of this data structure.
- *Queue.java*: Array based queue that follows the generic FIFO structure.
- *DriverP1.java*: Driver used to test Queue.java.
- *Deq.java*: This class contains an array based doubly ended queue. Items can be taken off the back of the queue like a stack, or can be dequeued from the front of the queue.
- *DriverP2.java*: Test Driver for Deq.java.
