# Array List:
# Author: Philip S. Quinn
## Version: 1/15/18
### Arrays are initialized to size of 3. Drivers are provided to allow for testing of the these lists.
- *ListArrayBased.java*: Within this class you will find an array based List with functionality analogous with Java's ArrayList class. Shifting is implemented to ensure list structure.
- *ListArrayBasedPlus.java*: Adds resizing to allow for lists greater than size of 3. toString() method added and reverse() method to reverse the order of the list.
- *ListArrayListBased.java*: Implements the same functionality as ListArrayBased but using Java's ArrayList instead of an array. Shows that a data structure can be based on any underlying data structure.
- *ListArrayListBasedPlus.java*: Implements reverse() and toString() just as ListArrayBasedPlus.
