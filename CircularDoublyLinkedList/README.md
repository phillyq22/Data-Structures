# Circular Doubly Linked List
# Author: Philip S. Quinn
## Version: 1/15/18
### A Circular Doubly Linked Structure (CDLS) is an improvement on the ListReferencedBased by allowing for access at both ends of the list. Arrays are initialized to size of 3. Drivers are provided to allow for testing of the these lists.
- *NodeD.java*: Node with two references; one to the previous and one to the next node in the CDLS. 
- *ListCDLSBased.java*: The improved ReferencedBasedList that allows for entry to the list on both ends.
- *Driver.java*: Test Driver for ListCDLSBased.java.
