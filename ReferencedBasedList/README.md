# Author: Philip S. Quinn
## Version: 1/15/18
- *Node.java*: Node object that contains a reference to the Node following it and the item it contains.
- *ListReferencedBased.java*: Linked list structure using nodes instead of an array.
- *MyListReferencedPlus.java*: This is the same Linked List as in ListReferencedBased, but does not keep track of the number of items.
